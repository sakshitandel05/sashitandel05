## Projects
Smart Waste Segregation System (IoT)
### Description
This project uses an ultrasonic sensor and a soil moisture sensor to detect whether the waste is **wet or dry**, and then moves a servo motor to dispose of it into the correct bin.

### Components Used
 Arduino Uno
 Ultrasonic Sensor
 Soil Moisture Sensor
 Servo Motor 
 Jumper wires, Breadboard

### Programming Language & Libraries
 **Language:** Arduino (C/C++)
 **Platform:** Arduino IDE
 **Libraries:** Servo.h
 **Code:** [SmartDustbinCode.ipynb](https://github.com/sakshitandel05/smart-dustbin-code)
Backup -> [README.md](https://github.com/sakshitandel05/IoT-code.git) 

### Functionality
 Measures distance to detect waste presence
 Reads soil sensor to determine moisture content
 Classifies waste as **wet** or **dry**
 Rotates servo motor to guide waste to respective section
